# Entur AI Agents POC

> Centralized AI agent instructions for generating standardized code with Entur best practices.

## What is this?

This repository contains documentation that AI coding agents (Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, etc.) consume to generate code that follows Entur's platform conventions. Instead of duplicating standards across every repository, teams reference this shared source.

## Quick Start

Create an `AGENTS.md` file in your repository root that points the AI agent to this repository:

```markdown
# My Application

Java 21 / Spring Boot application that provides the route planning API.

## Entur Standards

Read and follow the Entur platform standards at:
https://github.com/entur/ai/blob/main/AGENTS.md

When working on a specific task, also read the relevant docs
linked from that file (e.g. java.md, helm.md, docker.md).

## Project-Specific

- Uses PostgreSQL via Cloud SQL
- Publishes events to Pub/Sub topic `route-updates`
- Custom health indicator for external route provider connectivity
```

That's it. `AGENTS.md` is read automatically by Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, and Cursor. The agent will fetch the linked URL to get the full platform standards.

### Tips for a good `AGENTS.md`

- **Describe your application** in the first few lines -- language, framework, what it does
- **Link to the shared standards** so the agent knows Entur conventions
- **Add project-specific context** -- database, messaging, special patterns, team conventions
- **List any overrides** if your project deviates from the shared standards

### Example for a Go service

```markdown
# My Go Service

Go 1.23 service that processes transit data feeds.

## Entur Standards

Read and follow the Entur platform standards at:
https://github.com/entur/ai/blob/main/AGENTS.md

## Project-Specific

- Uses Cloud Pub/Sub for event processing
- Stores processed data in BigQuery
- No external API -- internal consumer only
```

## Agent Compatibility

| Agent          | Reads `AGENTS.md` | Can fetch URLs | Notes                                                    |
| -------------- | ----------------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Claude Code    | Yes               | Yes            | Fetches the linked URL and follows the documentation map |
| GitHub Copilot | Yes               | Limited        | Reads `AGENTS.md`; may not fetch URLs in all modes       |
| Cursor         | Yes               | Limited        | Reads `AGENTS.md`; may not fetch URLs in all modes       |

For agents that cannot fetch URLs, the most important rules are already inline in your project's `AGENTS.md`. For deeper coverage, you can copy key sections from this repo into your project's instructions.

## Documentation Structure

```text
AGENTS.md                       # Top-level agent routing and critical rules
CONVENTIONS.md                  # Cross-language coding conventions
docs/
  java.md                       # Java standards (Spring Boot, Gradle)
  kotlin.md                     # Kotlin standards
  go.md                         # Go standards
  docker.md                     # Containerization with Docker
  api-design.md                 # REST and gRPC API design
  architecture.md               # Service and infrastructure architecture
  logging.md                    # Structured logging
  observability.md              # Health checks, metrics, tracing
  security.md                   # Secrets, scanning, IAM
  code-review.md                # Review checklist
  helm.md                       # Entur common Helm chart reference
  self-service.md               # Self-service provisioning, manifests, onboarding
  markdown.md                   # Markdown standards and linting
  terraform/
    modules.md                  # Terraform modules (init, SQL, Redis, GCS)
    iam-roles.md                # Approved IAM roles
  cicd/
    workflows.md                # CI/CD pipeline reference
    actions.md                  # Composite actions reference
```

AI agents read `AGENTS.md` first, which routes them to the relevant sub-documents based on the task.
